The project involves the creation of a standard login/sign up page using resources from Figma.
I created the above page using only HTML and CSS, CSS mediaqueries were used to make the page responsive to enable viewing on smaller screens and I ensured all written code was clean and understandable.
The project can be run by simply clicking on the index.html file, this will open up the project in your default browser.
Thank you fro reading.
Kind regards,
